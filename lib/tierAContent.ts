  "seattle-residential": {
    intro: `Seattle's residential neighborhoods each impose their own logistical demands, and the difference between a smooth move and a stressful one often comes down to whether your moving company has done it before. Capitol Hill's dense blocks require SDOT temporary no-parking permits filed 72 hours in advance — we handle that paperwork on your behalf. Queen Anne's steep grades demand properly loaded trucks and experienced drivers who know how to position a 26-foot box truck on a hillside. Ballard and Fremont have overhead utility lines that limit truck height on certain residential streets, so we scout routes before move day. Our crews have been navigating Seattle's neighborhoods since 2009, and that institutional knowledge is built into every quote we give.`,
    buildingCalloutsHeading: "Seattle Neighborhoods We Know Best",
    buildingCallouts: `We move homes in every Seattle neighborhood, but some areas come up most often: Capitol Hill (permit coordination on Broadway and Pine), Queen Anne (steep lots on 1st Ave N and Taylor Ave N), Ballard (narrow residential streets in the 24th Ave NW corridor), Magnolia (long driveways and limited street access), Beacon Hill (steep grades and parking restrictions near the light rail station), and South Lake Union (new construction with loading dock coordination). If your home is in any of these areas, mention it when you request a quote — we'll flag any access issues before move day.`,
    extraFaqs: [
      {
        q: "Do you handle the SDOT parking permit for Seattle home moves?",
        a: "Yes. For moves in Capitol Hill, Belltown, First Hill, and other dense Seattle neighborhoods where street parking is limited, we file the SDOT temporary no-parking permit on your behalf. The permit reserves curb space for our truck so we can park directly in front of your home. We handle the application, the fee, and the posting — you don't have to do anything.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can you move a home on Queen Anne's steep streets?",
        a: "Yes — Queen Anne is one of our most active areas. We use properly loaded trucks with weight distributed toward the rear for steep-grade streets, and our drivers are trained on the specific grades on Taylor Ave N, 1st Ave N, and Queen Anne Ave N. We also carry wheel chocks and use them on every steep-street job. Call us to discuss your specific address and we'll confirm the right truck size.",

  "seattle-apartment": {
    intro: `Seattle's apartment market is among the most active in the country, and the logistics vary dramatically by building and neighborhood. South Lake Union high-rises — including buildings in the Amazon campus corridor — require elevator reservations booked 48–72 hours in advance and enforce strict move-in windows, typically 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays. Capitol Hill buildings like AVA Capitol Hill and The Danforth have their own COI requirements that name the building as additional insured. Ballard and Fremont low-rises have narrower truck access and often no freight elevator, which means stair carries and careful furniture disassembly. We call the building management before every move to confirm requirements, so none of it lands on you.`,
    buildingCalloutsHeading: "Seattle Apartment Buildings We Move Regularly",
    buildingCallouts: `We have on-file experience with the following Seattle apartment buildings and their specific requirements: Modera Ballard (elevator reservation, 4-hour window), AVA Capitol Hill (COI required, named insured), The Danforth (elevator key from management), Cascade Tower in South Lake Union (loading dock coordination, 2-hour window), Insignia Towers in Belltown (elevator reservation, $500 damage deposit), and 2nd & Pike in Downtown (street-level loading only, no dock). If your building isn't on this list, we'll call them directly — we do this for every move.`,
    extraFaqs: [
      {
        q: "My Seattle apartment building requires a certificate of insurance. Can you provide one?",
        a: "Yes. We carry general liability and cargo insurance and can provide a certificate of insurance (COI) naming your building as additional insured. Most buildings require this, and we've provided COIs for hundreds of Seattle buildings. When you book, let us know your building's requirements — we'll have the COI ready before move day.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if my Seattle apartment building only allows moves on weekdays?",
        a: "Many Seattle high-rises restrict moves to weekday business hours. We work Monday through Sunday and can accommodate weekday moves with advance notice. If your building has a specific move-in window (e.g., 8 a.m.–5 p.m. weekdays only), we'll schedule your move to start early enough to complete within that window. Let us know your building's restrictions when you request a quote.",

  "seattle-commercial": {
    intro: `Seattle's commercial moving market is shaped by its tech-heavy economy and the density of its office corridors. South Lake Union — home to Amazon's headquarters and dozens of tech companies — has loading dock schedules that require advance coordination and often restrict moves to off-peak hours. The Pioneer Square and Downtown core have street-level loading restrictions that require permits on certain blocks. Capitol Hill's Pike/Pine corridor has narrow alleys and limited truck access that require smaller vehicles for the final approach. Our commercial crews have relocated offices for companies ranging from five-person startups to 200-person teams, and we've done it in every major Seattle office building. We work evenings and weekends to keep your business running.`,
    buildingCalloutsHeading: "Seattle Office Buildings We Move Regularly",
    buildingCallouts: `We have direct experience with loading dock procedures and building requirements at: 1201 Third Avenue (after-hours loading dock, security escort required), Columbia Center (freight elevator reservation, 2-hour window), Amazon Day 1 Tower area buildings (loading dock scheduling through building management), WeWork locations on Capitol Hill and South Lake Union (standard COI, coordinate with community manager), and Pioneer Square buildings (street-level loading, SDOT permit required on certain blocks). For any Seattle office move, we recommend a free on-site walkthrough 1–2 weeks before your move date.`,
    extraFaqs: [
      {
        q: "Can you move our Seattle office over a weekend to avoid business disruption?",
        a: "Yes — weekend moves are our most common request for Seattle office relocations. We work Saturday and Sunday, and we can start as early as 6 a.m. to maximize your available time. Most Seattle office buildings allow weekend access with advance notice to building management. We'll coordinate directly with your building's security or property manager to confirm access.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do you handle IT equipment and server moves in Seattle?",
        a: "Yes. Our commercial crews are trained on IT equipment handling — monitors are wrapped and crated, towers are padded and secured upright, and server racks are handled with anti-static precautions. We do not disconnect or reconnect networking equipment, but we work alongside your IT team and can coordinate timing around their schedule. For server room moves, we recommend a pre-move walkthrough with your IT lead.",

    pricingNote: "Commercial rates include 2-person crew minimum. Larger crews quoted on-site.",
  },

  "seattle-packing": {
    intro: `Professional packing in Seattle is more nuanced than it looks. Capitol Hill apartments often have narrow hallways and tight stairwells that require furniture disassembly before packing can begin. South Lake Union high-rises have strict move-out inspection requirements, so every item needs to be packed in a way that prevents wall and floor damage during the carry-out. Ballard craftsman homes frequently have fragile vintage fixtures and antique furniture that require specialty wrapping. Our packing crews bring all materials — boxes, tape, bubble wrap, packing paper, wardrobe boxes, and specialty dish packs — and they're trained to pack for both protection and efficient loading. We also offer a fragile-only option for customers who want to pack most items themselves.`,
    buildingCalloutsHeading: "Packing Services Across Seattle Neighborhoods",
    buildingCallouts: `Our packing crews work throughout Seattle and are experienced with the specific challenges of each area: Capitol Hill and First Hill (tight stairwells, narrow hallways requiring furniture disassembly before packing), Magnolia and Madison Park (large homes with extensive art collections and antique furniture), Ballard and Fremont (craftsman homes with vintage fixtures and irregular-sized items), South Lake Union and Belltown (high-rise move-out inspections requiring careful floor and wall protection), and Queen Anne (steep-lot homes where packing sequence matters for load balance on the truck).`,
    extraFaqs: [
      {
        q: "How far in advance should I book packing services for a Seattle move?",
        a: "For most Seattle moves, booking 1–2 weeks in advance is sufficient. For peak season (May–September) and end-of-month dates, we recommend 3–4 weeks. If you're in a South Lake Union high-rise with a fixed move-out window, book as early as possible — we need to schedule the packing crew to finish the day before your move so the truck can load within your building's time window.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can you pack just my fragile items and art for my Seattle move?",
        a: "Yes. Fragile-only packing is one of our most popular options in Seattle, especially for homes in Magnolia, Madison Park, and Capitol Hill that have significant art collections or antique furniture. Our packers bring specialty materials — mirror boxes, dish packs, custom foam inserts, and wardrobe boxes — and they'll focus exclusively on the items you identify as fragile. Everything else you can pack yourself.",

  // ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  "bellevue-residential": {
    intro: `Bellevue home moves require a level of preparation that most moving companies don't provide. Somerset and Newport Hills have some of the steepest residential driveways on the Eastside — we assess access on every quote and bring the right equipment. The Crossroads and Lake Hills neighborhoods have dense townhome developments with shared driveways and HOA move-in windows that close at 5 p.m. sharp. West Bellevue and Medina have large estates with long carries and gated access that requires advance coordination with property managers. Our Redmond warehouse is five miles from central Bellevue — the closest of any major moving company — which means faster response times and lower fuel surcharges on your quote.`,
    buildingCalloutsHeading: "Bellevue Neighborhoods We Know Best",
    buildingCallouts: `We move homes throughout Bellevue and have specific experience with the access challenges in each area: Somerset (steep driveways on SE 60th St and Somerset Blvd SE, long carries), Newport Hills (narrow cul-de-sacs, limited truck turnaround), Crossroads (dense townhome complexes, shared driveways, HOA coordination), Factoria (newer construction with loading dock access for some complexes), Bridle Trails (gated community, advance notice required), and West Bellevue / Medina (large estates, long carries, private road access). Mention your neighborhood when you request a quote and we'll flag any access considerations.`,
    extraFaqs: [
      {
        q: "Do you move homes in gated Bellevue communities like Bridle Trails?",
        a: "Yes. We move in and out of gated communities throughout Bellevue regularly. For gated communities, we need the gate code or a contact number for the gate attendant — your HOA or property manager can provide this. We recommend confirming access details at least 48 hours before your move date. We've moved in Bridle Trails, Clyde Hill, and other gated Bellevue neighborhoods many times.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do you handle steep driveways in Somerset and Newport Hills?",
        a: "Steep driveways are one of the most common challenges in Bellevue's hillside neighborhoods. We assess driveway grade on every quote — if a driveway is too steep for our standard truck, we use a smaller vehicle for the driveway approach and shuttle items to the main truck on the street. We also carry wheel chocks and use them on every steep-grade job. There's no additional charge for this — it's part of our standard preparation for Bellevue hillside moves.",

  "bellevue-apartment": {
    intro: `Bellevue's apartment market spans a wide range — from luxury high-rises in Downtown to mid-rise complexes in Crossroads and Eastgate — and each building type has its own requirements. The Bravern and Cirrus in Downtown Bellevue require elevator reservations booked 48–72 hours in advance and enforce strict move-in windows. Bellevue Towers requires a $500 refundable damage deposit and a COI naming the building as additional insured. Crossroads and Eastgate complexes often have limited parking for moving trucks — we scout access points before move day to avoid blocking fire lanes or shared driveways. Our crews handle all building coordination before your move date so you don't have to navigate it yourself.`,
    buildingCalloutsHeading: "Bellevue Apartment Buildings We Move Regularly",
    buildingCallouts: `We have on-file experience with the following Bellevue apartment buildings: The Bravern (elevator reservation required, 8 a.m.–5 p.m. weekday window), Cirrus (COI required, named insured, elevator reservation), Bellevue Towers (damage deposit, COI, freight elevator only), The Ashton (Crossroads area, limited truck parking, side-street access), Overlook at Eastgate (mid-rise, standard elevator reservation), and Soma Towers (Downtown Bellevue, loading dock coordination).

    extraFaqs: [
      {
        q: "Does The Bravern in Downtown Bellevue require special moving procedures?",
        a: "Yes. The Bravern requires elevator reservations booked at least 48 hours in advance through building management. Moves are restricted to weekday hours (typically 8 a.m.–5 p.m.), and a certificate of insurance naming The Bravern as additional insured is required. We've moved in and out of The Bravern many times and have the COI template ready. When you book, let us know your unit and we'll handle the building coordination.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's the best time to schedule a Bellevue apartment move to avoid elevator conflicts?",
        a: "Mid-week mornings (Tuesday–Thursday, starting at 8 a.m.) are the least competitive for elevator reservations in Downtown Bellevue high-rises. Friday and Monday are the most popular move days and elevator slots fill up quickly. End-of-month dates (28th–31st) are the busiest across all Bellevue buildings. If you have flexibility, a mid-week move in the middle of the month will give you the most elevator access options.",
      },
    ],

  "bellevue-commercial": {
    intro: `Bellevue's commercial moving market is driven by its position as the Eastside's primary business hub. The Spring District — home to REI's headquarters, T-Mobile's campus, and dozens of tech companies — has loading dock schedules that require advance coordination and often restrict moves to after-hours or weekends. Downtown Bellevue's office towers on 106th Ave NE and Bellevue Way NE have freight elevator reservations that book out weeks in advance during peak season. The Bel-Red corridor has newer office parks with loading docks but limited street access for large trucks. Our commercial crews have relocated offices of every size in Bellevue, and we work evenings and weekends to keep your business running without interruption.`,

We'll coordinate directly with your building's property manager and can work weekends or evenings to minimize business disruption.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do you provide chain-of-custody documentation for Bellevue office moves?",
        a: "Yes. For commercial moves that require documentation — particularly IT equipment, server moves, and confidential file transfers — we provide an itemized inventory with condition notes for every item. Each box is numbered and logged. We can also provide a signed chain-of-custody form if your company requires it for compliance purposes.",

  "bellevue-packing": {
    intro: `Bellevue homes tend to be larger and better-furnished than the regional average, which means packing takes longer and requires more specialty materials than a typical move. Somerset and Newport Hills estates often have extensive art collections, antique furniture, and custom cabinetry that require custom crating or specialty wrapping. Downtown Bellevue high-rises have strict move-out inspection requirements — every item needs to be packed and carried out in a way that prevents damage to common area walls and floors. Our Bellevue packing crews bring all materials and are trained on the full range of specialty packing: mirror boxes, dish packs, wardrobe boxes, custom foam inserts, and flat-screen TV boxes.

    extraFaqs: [

        q: "Can you pack and move our Bellevue home on the same day?",
        a: "Yes, for homes up to 2 bedrooms. For a same-day pack-and-move, we send a larger crew — typically 3–4 people — so packing and loading can happen simultaneously. One team packs while another loads the truck. This works well for Bellevue apartments and smaller homes. For 3+ bedroom homes, we recommend packing the day before the move to ensure everything is ready when the truck arrives.",

      {
        q: "Do you provide custom crating for art and antiques in Bellevue?",
        a: "Yes. For high-value art, antiques, and fragile collectibles, we offer custom crating using wood or foam-lined boxes built to the specific dimensions of your item. This is particularly common for Bellevue clients in Somerset and West Bellevue who have significant art collections. Custom crating is quoted separately — contact us with photos and dimensions of the items you need crated.",
