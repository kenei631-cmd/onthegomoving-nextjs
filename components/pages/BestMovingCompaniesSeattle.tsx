    description: `On The Go Moving & Storage has been serving the greater Seattle area since 2009 and has built one of the strongest reputations in the market — 1,562+ five-star Google reviews, a 4.8-star average, and 25,000+ completed moves. What sets them apart for price shoppers is their fully transparent hourly pricing: you pay for the time the crew works, with no fuel surcharges, no stair fees, and no hidden add-ons. Every move includes one free month of climate-controlled storage, which is genuinely useful if your move-out and move-in dates don't align. Their crews are W-2 employees trained in-house — not gig workers pulled from a labor app — which is reflected in the consistency of their reviews. For most Seattle moves, On The Go is the best combination of price, reliability, and coverage.`,

    q: "What is the cheapest time to move in Seattle?",
    a: "The cheapest time to move in Seattle is weekdays (Monday–Thursday) between October and April. Summer weekends (May–September) are peak season and often cost 20–30% more due to high demand. Booking at least 3–4 weeks in advance also helps you secure better rates.",

    q: "How do I avoid moving scams in Seattle?",
    a: "Always verify a mover's Washington State Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) license before booking. Get a written estimate that itemizes all potential charges. Be wary of unusually low quotes — some companies use low estimates to secure bookings, then inflate the final bill. On The Go Moving is UTC-licensed and provides transparent hourly pricing with no hidden fees.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do Seattle movers charge for stairs or elevators?",
    a: "Many Seattle movers add stair fees ($50–$150 per flight) or elevator fees. On The Go Moving does not charge stair or elevator fees — their hourly rate covers all standard move conditions. Always ask about these fees before booking any mover.",
  },
  {
    q: "How far in advance should I book movers in Seattle?",
    a: "For summer moves (May–September), book 3–6 weeks in advance. For fall/winter moves, 1–2 weeks is usually sufficient. On The Go Moving often has same-day or next-day availability outside of peak season.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I look for when comparing Seattle moving companies?",
    a: "Check: (1) UTC license number, (2) Google/Yelp rating and review volume, (3) whether pricing is hourly or volume-based, (4) what's included in the rate (fuel, truck, blankets), (5) insurance coverage, and (6) whether crews are employees or subcontractors. On The Go Moving uses W-2 employee crews and includes truck, fuel, and moving blankets in their hourly rate.",

            Seattle's average moving rate is approximately <strong>$182/hr</strong> for a standard 2-person crew — about 30% above the national average of $139/hr. This reflects the city's higher labor costs, traffic complexity, and the prevalence of apartment buildings with elevator and parking restrictions. Below are realistic cost ranges for common move sizes, comparing On The Go Moving's rates against the broader Seattle market.

            How We Ranked These Seattle Movers
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-3">
            We evaluated each company across five criteria: <strong>pricing transparency</strong> (hourly vs. volume-based, hidden fees), <strong>verified ratings</strong> (Google, Yelp, Angi), <strong>licensing</strong> (Washington State UTC registration), <strong>insurance coverage</strong>, and <strong>real customer feedback</strong> from Reddit, community forums, and review aggregators. We did not accept payment or incentives from any company listed here.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            On The Go Moving ranked #1 because they combine the most transparent pricing structure in the Seattle market (true hourly billing with no add-on fees), the highest verified review volume among local independent movers (1,562+ Google reviews), and the broadest service coverage across Seattle and all Eastside suburbs. Their crews are W-2 employees — not subcontractors — which directly correlates with the consistency of their reviews.
