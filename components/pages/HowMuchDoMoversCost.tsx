const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to hire movers in Seattle?",
    a: "In Seattle and the Eastside, most local moves cost between $300 and $1,600 depending on home size, crew size, and move duration. A studio or 1-bedroom typically runs $300–$600 with a 2-person crew. A 2–3 bedroom home averages $600–$1,200 with a 3-person crew. On The Go Moving charges by the hour with no hidden fees.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much do movers charge per hour?",
    a: "On The Go Moving charges by the hour based on crew size. All rates include the moving truck, fuel, basic equipment, and standard valuation coverage. Call us or request a free quote for current rates — pricing varies by season, availability, and move details.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it cheaper to move yourself or hire movers?",
    a: "For most moves in the Seattle area, hiring professional movers is cost-competitive with DIY when you factor in truck rental, fuel, equipment, and your time. A 2-bedroom DIY move (truck + supplies + time) typically costs $400–$700. A professional 2-bedroom move with On The Go Moving runs $450–$800 — and you don't have to do any of the heavy lifting.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is included in the hourly moving rate?",
    a: "On The Go Moving's hourly rate includes the moving truck, fuel, moving blankets and pads, dollies and straps, basic furniture disassembly and reassembly, and standard valuation coverage (60 cents per pound per article). Full-value replacement protection is available for an additional fee.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do movers charge for stairs?",
    a: "On The Go Moving does not charge a flat stair fee. However, stairs and elevators add time to the move, which increases the total cost at our hourly rate. A building with a slow elevator or multiple flights of stairs can add 30–90 minutes to a typical move.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to move a 2-bedroom apartment?",
    a: "Moving a 2-bedroom apartment in Seattle or the Eastside typically costs $450–$900 with On The Go Moving. We recommend a 3-person crew for most 1–2 bedroom apartments because the extra mover reduces total hours and often results in a lower final bill than a 2-person crew.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer free storage with a move?",
    a: "Yes. On The Go Moving includes one free month of storage at our Redmond, WA facility with every move. This is particularly useful for apartment renters with a gap between move-out and move-in dates.",
  },
  {
    q: "How far in advance should I book movers?",
    a: "We recommend booking at least 3–4 weeks in advance, especially for moves during peak season (June–September) or on weekends. Last-minute bookings within 7 days are possible but subject to availability.",
  },

                Apartments &amp; Condos Often Cost More Than You Expect
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                With studios and small apartments, the amount of furniture usually isn't the problem — the <strong>building is</strong>. Slow elevators, loading docks, tight parking, and other moving companies using the same space can add significant time to your move.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                For most 1–2 bedroom apartments and condos, we recommend <strong>3 movers instead of 2</strong>. It can feel like you're saving money with fewer movers — but in most apartment moves, the extra mover reduces total hours and often results in a <em>lower</em> final bill.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-[#f0f7e6] rounded-xl p-5 border" style={{ borderColor: "#c5e08a" }}>

                  <CheckCircle size={16} className="inline mr-2" style={{ color: "#75aa11" }} />
                  Example: A 2-bedroom apartment with a slow elevator. 2 movers × 6 hours = $960. 3 movers × 4 hours = $720. The extra mover saved $240 and 2 hours.
