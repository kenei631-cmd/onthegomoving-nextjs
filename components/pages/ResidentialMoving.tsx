const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How much does residential moving cost in Seattle?",
    answer: "Most residential moves in the Greater Seattle area cost $100–$175 per hour for a 2-person crew with a truck. A typical 1-bedroom apartment move runs $350–$600, a 2-bedroom home runs $600–$1,200, and a 3-bedroom home runs $1,000–$2,000. On The Go Moving provides flat-rate quotes so you know the exact price before your move date — no surprise charges.",
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book residential movers in Seattle?",
    answer: "We recommend booking 2–4 weeks in advance for most moves. Summer months (June–August) and end-of-month dates book out fastest — for those, 4–6 weeks is ideal. That said, we accommodate last-minute moves when availability allows. Call us and we'll let you know what's open.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you move apartments with stairs or no elevator?",
    answer: "Yes — stairs and no-elevator buildings are a routine part of our work across Seattle and the Eastside. Our crews are trained and equipped for multi-story apartment moves. We factor stair access into your quote upfront so there are no surprises on move day.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is included in a full-service residential move?",
    answer: "A full-service residential move with On The Go Moving includes: a trained 2–4 person crew, a moving truck, all moving equipment (dollies, furniture pads, straps, floor runners), careful loading and unloading, and placement of furniture in your new home. Packing and unpacking services are available as an add-on.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer free storage with a residential move?",
    answer: "Yes. Every residential move with On The Go Moving includes 1 free month of climate-controlled storage at our Redmond, WA facility. This is especially useful if there's a gap between your move-out and move-in dates.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are your movers licensed and insured?",
    answer: "Yes. On The Go Moving & Storage is fully licensed (WA HG-064180) and insured with USDOT# 2120054. All crew members are background-checked and professionally trained. We carry full liability coverage on every move.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you move heavy or specialty items like a piano or safe?",
    answer: "Yes. We have specialized equipment and trained crews for pianos, safes, pool tables, gun safes, and other oversized or heavy items. Please mention these items when requesting your quote so we can bring the right equipment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you move condos and high-rise apartments in Seattle?",
    answer: "Yes. We regularly move residents in and out of high-rise condos and apartments throughout Seattle, Bellevue, and the Eastside. We coordinate elevator reservations, building move-in/move-out windows, and parking permits as part of our service.",
